# GigaHurt (Fall 2018 - Group Game Project)

This is the group project I worked on in the GIMM 110 class of Fall 2018.
The other contributors to this project are Joey Rowell and Parker Ussery.

The project requires the GreenSock library. Just drop "greensock.swc" into the root folder and it should run.
