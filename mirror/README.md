# Mirror (Spring 2019 - Group Game Project)

This is the group project I worked on in the GIMM 250 class of Spring 2019.

I was responsible for the code, but other people helped with the art and sound!

Thanks to:
+ Alex Becerril
+ Caleb Cram
+ Cole Rene
+ Sydney Wayne-Riddle
+ Hannah Wiles

The project requires the Starling library. Just drop "starling.swc" into the root folder and it should run.
