# Terra (Spring 2019 - Interactive Comic)

This is the interactive comic project I worked on in the GIMM 250 class of Spring 2019.
The other contributors to this project are:
+ Alex Becerril
+ Caleb Cram
+ Cole Rene
+ Sydney Wayne-Riddle
+ Hannah Wiles

The project requires the GreenSock library. Just drop "greensock.swc" into the root folder and it should run.
